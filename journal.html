    <h3>Personal Log</h3>
    <p>A not so quick update, As week one is a lie, This is just the first week ive actually made a journal update.
        its been about 1 month now since I've gotten into this journey properly and developed a bit of a path and idea of where I want to go.
        This is my place to let my mind run and write down all my thoughts, ideas and insanity. I dont apologize.

        So far I have started and worked through my first section of <em>The Odin Project</em>. I have decided to start with the javascript pathway and have worked my way through to CSS Basics.
        This is early days so I still have lots of learning and research to do but I think I would like to work towards helping small businesses, whetehr that be building their websites, SaaS, Tools etc.
        My first glimpse at programming was in Highschool. I cant remember what language we were using "I think it was Java" but we built a small grocery calculator interface. It was probably my most memorable amd enjoyable class I had.

        Since then before starting <em>The Odin Project</em> I have completed an introductory programming course for python through TAFE NSW, We built a basic login/user registration thing where you could make an account, Log in, It would track time logged in, allow you to change your password, generate a password for you and check it met minimum standards and had an admin login where you can see all user info.
        Now I've started this. I am enjoying it so far but my mind has always lived in the more mathematical problemsolving side and no so much this side of front end where I build things like this. But I enjoy it and it will be good for me.

        A current look at my position in life. I currently work "fulltime" doing 3 days a week 12.5 hour shifts away from my family "Married with 2 kids and a third on the way". It pays the bills and allows us to save on a single income. However long term this is the route and career I want to build towards so I can work more remtely and be with family more.
